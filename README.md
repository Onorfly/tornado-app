# tornado-app
Using python and mysql, create a small web application that mimics the process of walking through a house and interacting with objects.
· The house is a collection of connected rooms.
· Each room has 1 to N objects.
· Users can move from room to room.
· Users should be able to "pick up" objects and bring them from room to room.
· User's current state (room user is in) should be persistent — so that the user can close the browser and return to the same position.
· Minimum 4 "rooms" in the house.
· Minimum 3 "objects".
· Output should be a deployable application — include readme file with any necessary deployment instructions.
· Any detail left unspecified is completely up to you (e.g. text commands vs point and click, how are the rooms connected, where does the player start, etc)
For using tornado.
Bonus marks for enabling multiple users (and still preserving state)
— hint: authentication would be required (username / password).
— hint: use of jquery where appropriate — and / or AJAX to improve user experience.
